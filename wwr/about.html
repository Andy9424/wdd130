                    <p>In the heart of San Agustín, Huila, the Angulo family turned their love for adventure and the natural
                        beauty of the Magdalena River into a rafting business. Starting with just a few rafts and a deep
                        respect for the river's power, they began guiding visitors through its thrilling rapids. The family
                        faced many struggles—unpredictable weather, tough terrain, and limited equipment—but their passion
                        kept them going. With each trip, they shared their knowledge of the river's history and the
                        surrounding mountains, creating unforgettable memories for their guests.

                    <p>One day, a powerful storm hit while a group of tourists was on the river. The water rose quickly,
                    and the group was in danger. Without hesitation, the Sánchez family raced to help, expertly
                    navigating the dangerous rapids and bringing everyone to safety. This brave act earned them the
                    trust and admiration of their clients. Today, Sánchez Rafting is known for its dedication, offering
                    visitors a mix of adventure and cultural experiences while showing off the stunning landscapes of
                    San Agustín, Huila.</p>
